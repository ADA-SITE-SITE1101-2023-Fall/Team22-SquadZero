                <br><br><h2>About our Website Project</h2>
                <p style="font-size:large;">During creating the website we each member of our team participated and contributed to the 
                    project. All of us completed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses and learned the basics of website development. 
                    Moreover, as one of the member of our team already worked with these technologies and had experience on using them, 
                    so when one of our members had a problem he explained how to do it right. We also learned some additional 
                    information about these languages in the Internet by ourselves. We started creating the website while learning the 
                    courses, so we always needed to rethink and rebuild our codes by learning about these languages. We cut our project 
                    in different parts and distributed them among our team members, and always kept connection with each other to 
                    synchronize our codes. We also, made some corrections to each otherâ€™s codes. 
                    We also used many functionalities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and tried our best to create our website. 
                    Furthermore, we made some JavaScript interaction, which is used in HourofCode.html file. We did some kind of 
                    slides of images from our Hour of Code event.
