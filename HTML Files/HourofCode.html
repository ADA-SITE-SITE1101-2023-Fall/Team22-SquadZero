                <br><br><h2>What happened in our Hour of Code event</h2>
                <p style="font-size:large;">Today we write a report about unforgettable experience in our life. When Dr. Araz sent 
                    us HW2 as a go to school and teach Code.org to students we were happy, because it was our first experience as a
                    tutor. It was an unforgettable experience for us because we, as a group of 22, held our #Hour of Code event
                    dedicated to the computer science week of December 4-10. The members of our group are Telman Alakbarov, 
                    Nihad Ahmadov, Mahammad Mammadli, and Orkhan Dervishov. Now I want to give you more detailed information about
                    this unforgettable experience. First we came together in University and discussed what we will do. Each member                       of group said their own opinion we because, wanted to find out the method and plan, so we can explain Code.org
                    perfectly. We read the instruction many times and we look the slide which give information about ADA University.
                    Than we reserved a room in University and we prepared our plan about this event. We should find a school.
                    We started to look for a some middle school first, and as you know, when we called which school and said that
                    we wanted to come and have a lesson, they asked us to get official permission from the Ministry of Education, 
                    or ADA University, and this created a certain amount of difficulty, and then Telman's family friend was the director
                    of school number 32. Telman talked to him and said that our team wanted to organize the Hour of Code, and she told
                    us that we could do it without a permit, and she accepted it. For these we thank the director of school number 32.
                    Before choosing school number we talked with Sumgait 22 school and 217 School in Baku, but these schools wanted a 
                    special permission from Ministry of Education or Ada University. One day before this event we again reserved a room 
                    and we did practice many times because we wanted every student participate in explanation and we decided who explain 
                    which parts for example Telman Alakbarov will begin to introduce presentation of ADA University and give information 
                    about Ada University, than Mahammad Mammadli  give  Information about faculties such as Information Technology and 
                    Math than Orkhan Dervishov give information about Computer engineering and Computer science at the end Nihad Ahmadov
                    give information about Electric and electrical engineering faculty and successes of Ada Universty. At the end of 
                    presentation about Ada University we gave phone numbers to pupils because if they want to get extra information they will 
                    be able to ask them by calling these numbers. After it we decided that each members of group will explain some part of 
                    Code.org and we decided while one student explaining another student will sit in front of computer and other students will 
                    record the video and take pictures. First Telman Alakbarov begin explaining and Mahammad Mammadli sit in front of computer 
                    and Nihad Ahmadov record video after Telman Alakbarov and  Orkhan Dervishov will explain another part of Code.org than Nihad 
                    Ahmadov and Mahammad Mammadli.  First, we entered the school we felt a little bit confused because it was our first experience 
                    as a tutor. At first we waited in teachers' room in there we remember what we should do. Then we entered classroom, and we 
                    tried to open smartboard and our computers all of us take our computer but unfortunately in our computer there is no DVI port, 
                    so because of this reason we could not connect smartboard and we upset because all of our lesson constructed on smart board. 
                    Suddenly teacher said that I can give you my own computer, because there is DVI port in this computer, and we used this 
                    computer and we got everything ready. Then the children came. There were 30 participants. Firstly they thought that it is 
                    an exam which organized by Ministry of Education. We explain that we came from ADA University and we will have one lesson 
                    with them and we started with the first presentation about ADA University. While we were giving information they listen 
                    carefully. They are sixth grade pupils and the university life is interesting for them. Some pupils said that their aim 
                    is to enter ADA University in the future. Than as you know, Code.org makes it easier to learn coding with various interesting 
                    games, and because of this, even young children can learn coding. In Code.org they learn codding with interesting  angry birds. 
                    During the Hour of Code, we made it important to get the ideas of the children and asked them how they would solve these tasks. 
                    What is interesting is that among the participants there were those who took Code.org and similar courses, and this brought special 
                    interest to our lesson. While solving these tasks some participants answer immediately and it was interesting because despite they 
                    were seeing these tasks for the first time and they answered them correctly at the end of class we ask them how they answer these 
                    questions immediately  one of them said that his father is an Information Technology specialist and he learn from his father, 
                    another participant said that he used his logic to find answer. The willingness of the participants and their interest in coding 
                    about Code org showed that they liked our lessons and Code org, and this made us happy. Everything went well during the lesson. 
                    We wanted to continue the lesson and give them more tasks about Code.org but unfortunately they have another lesson and they should 
                    participate it and could not stay with us. At the end of the event we took the names of the most active participants and prepared 
                    certificates for them. Also, at the end of class we ask them did they like codding and did they learn something about the codding. 
                    Most of the participants said that they liked codding and maybe they will continue it at home. We are happy that we support them 
                    because may be one of these pupils will become the one of the most powerful and skillful codding specialist in the future.</p>
